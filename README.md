# Golang Game Engine
## What is the *Golang Game Engine*?
The *Golang Game Engine* is a library for "physics" logic. It provides a composition-based architecture, so that means easy swaping-in and swaping-out of components to achive desired functionality.
## What can I use to render sprites
I would recommend ebiten. The github page is [here](http://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) and the documentation [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten). There are many great tutorials and the implementation allows for different libraries to be intergrated into your project (such as [image/draw](http://godoc.org/image/draw)).
## Where is the documentation?
The documentation for this project can be found [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/goisgreat/go-physics).
